#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  This program will have a time complexity of:
    Worst/Average case: O(n)
    Best case: O(1)
    
    Justification: O(n^3) from the condition and O(n^2) from the statement cancel out to O(n). As n gets bigger the time to run the program increases at the same rate.


b)  This program will have a time complexity of:
    Worst/Average case: O(n^2)
    Best case: O(n)

    Justification: Nested loops therefore the time will increase exponentionally as n becomes larger.


c)  This program will have a time complexity of:
    Worst/Average case: O(n)
    Best case: O(1)

    Justification: 2 + bunnyEars(n - 1) simplifies to O(n). As n gets bigger the time to run the program increases at the same rate.
